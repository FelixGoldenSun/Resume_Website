          <p>This is a site that was made for my PHP class in college.</p>
          <p> It contains a calendar, a contact me page that sends email, and some working blog systems.
            The blog (Not the article or product one) also has comments and a rating system.
            The site is connected to a database that stores all of the comments, and has a full CRUD system implemented.
            The site uploaded to GitHub wonâ€™t work with the database, but you can see the live version
            <a href="http://www.cis230.benawalls.com/index.php">here</a>.
            If you login you can add, edit, and delete articles and the like. The username is jcd, and the password is bionicman.</p>
          <p>You can check out the source code on <a href="https://github.com/FelixGoldenSun/CIS_230_PHP/tree/master">GitHub</a>.
