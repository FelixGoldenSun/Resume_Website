          <p>This project was to make a site for a company that sells cooking equipment, in ASP.net.</p>
          <p>Specifically, with web forms. At this point web forms seems to be getting replaced with MVC, but it still
            allows for the creation of a quick and easy website. Itâ€™s even responsive out of the gate! This site is
            mostly just for trying out some of the features of web forms, and practice connecting to a SQL database.
            Also of note is that this site is deployed on Microsoft Azure, with actually is pretty easy to use. </p>
          <p>You can see a live example of the site <a href="http://cooknook-walls.azurewebsites.net/">here</a> or check it out on
            <a href="https://github.com/FelixGoldenSun/Cook_Nook_Site/tree/master">GitHub</a>. If you check out the live site,
            you need to create a login to see some of the pages. Sometimes logging in causes an error, just refresh the
            page if that happens. </p>
