          <p>This was a project to create a working calendar in PHP. You can click the links to go back and forward in time.</p>
          <p>The trickiest part was when it switches year. Well, not that tricky, but it did take me longer than I thought it would.
            The code was originally made in Ruby, for a Rails project. I just changed the syntax and it worked just fine. </p>
          <p>You can see the source code on <a href="https://github.com/FelixGoldenSun/resume_website/blob/master/templates/functions.php">GitHub</a>.
            Itâ€™s the function called miniCalendar.</p>
